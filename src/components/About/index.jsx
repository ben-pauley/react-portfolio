              I am a {myAge} year old full stack web developer based in Worcestershire, UK with skills in React,
              MongoDB, node.js, JavaScript, jQuery, Node.js, mySQL and more. I studied at the University of
              Birmingham Coding Boot Camp and have worked as a Web Developer for Anders Pink. I spend most of my down
              time exploring my love of film and music. My passion for these arts has led me into a love of physical
              media too, with my Blu-ray and record collections ever expanding. These passions occasionally seep into
              my work as well, which you may see on my projects page.
